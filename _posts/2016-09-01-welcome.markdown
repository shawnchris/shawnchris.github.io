Glad to re-start our study group! 

* How do we meet?  
We will try to use Skype as communication platform. Search shawn.chris.gao@outlook.com and add me as friend.

* Where to find study materials we used before?  
Check out [this folder in my Github](https://github.com/shawnchris/studygroup/tree/master/Shawn)

* Want to check in code to studygroup repo?  
Sure, [follow me](https://github.com/shawnchris) in Github and I will grant you access.

* What the meeting schedule?  
Check out [other posts](https://shawnchris.github.io) :)

**Happy Coding!**
